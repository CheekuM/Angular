***************Short Notes on Angular Basics ******************
- Copy the latest CDN from http://angularjs.org/ 
- To create angular app, we use "ng-app='SampleProject'"

- app.js includes "var app = angular.module('SampleProject',[]);" - This file is creating Angular js app called SampleProject and assigning it to app variable

- mainController.js -"app.controller("MainController",function($scope){});" assiging controller to the SampleProject app
	
	In $scope, we will assign all our controller variable which will then available in html page
	
	Eg :- "$scope.understand="Hey There! I am using Angular""
	In html, we will directly use understand with {{}} to access the value of understand 
	Eg :-  <div id='content' ng-app='SampleProject' ng-controller='MainController'>{{understand}}</div>
	
	## scope variable is available only to that controller so you could not access the variable outside #content DIV unless the same controller is defined
